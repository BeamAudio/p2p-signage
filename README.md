# AccioTv P2P Signage System

This repository contains the core components for a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) signage system, designed to distribute content efficiently across a network of nodes. The system is built with a Dart-based P2P application and a Python script for protocol analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure

- `p2p-signage/p2p_signage_dart`: The main Dart application implementing the P2P node logic.
- `p2p-signage/log_parser.py`: A Python script for analyzing and visualizing the protocol logs generated by the Dart application.

## Features

- **Decentralized Communication:** P2P architecture for robust content distribution.
- **Authentication & Encryption:** Secure communication between peers.
- **Gossip Protocol:** Efficient peer discovery and network state propagation.
- **Content Distribution:** Mechanisms for announcing, requesting, and sharing content.
- **Protocol Analysis Tools:** A Python script to visualize network traffic, message flows, and participant states.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Dart SDK:** [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- **Python 3:** [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd AccioTv
```

### 2. Set up the Dart Application

Navigate to the Dart project directory and fetch dependencies:

```bash
cd p2p-signage/p2p_signage_dart
dart pub get
```

### 3. Run the Dart Application (Example)

You can run the tests to simulate network activity and generate logs:

```bash
dart test test/core/multi_isolate_test.dart
```

Or, you can build and run individual nodes. Refer to `p2p-signage/p2p_signage_dart/README.md` for more details.

### 4. Use the Python Log Analysis Script

Navigate back to the project root and run the Python script with a log file:

```bash
cd ../..
python p2p-signage/log_parser.py p2p-signage/p2p_signage_dart/multi_isolate_log.txt
```

This script will output:
- A Wireshark-like table of UDP packets.
- Packet statistics (total, incoming, outgoing).
- A textual time plot of message activity.
- ASCII art sequence diagrams.
- ASCII art activity flows.
- ASCII art state flows for each participant.

Refer to `p2p-signage/README.md` for more details on the Python script.
