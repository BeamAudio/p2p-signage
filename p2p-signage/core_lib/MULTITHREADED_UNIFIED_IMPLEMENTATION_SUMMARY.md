# P2P Unified Network Stack with Multithreading Implementation

## Overview

This project successfully unifies multiple P2P networking components into a single, cohesive implementation with multithreading support. The implementation combines:

- Core P2P networking functionality (STUN/TURN/ICE)
- Reliability protocols (ACK/NACK)
- Network abstraction layer (gossip protocol, data management)
- Multithreading for improved performance

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Real IP Address Support
- Updated tests to work with actual discovered public and private IP addresses
- Removed hardcoded localhost configurations
- Implemented proper IP discovery from network interfaces and STUN servers

### 2. Code Unification
- Consolidated functionality from multiple files into a single `unified_p2p_socket.dart`
- Retained all original functionality while eliminating redundancy
- Removed `reliable_p2p_socket.dart` as its features are now integrated
- Streamlined `p2p_socket.dart` to contain only core networking functionality

### 3. Multithreading Implementation
- Added isolate-based multithreading for network operations
- Created worker isolates for CPU-intensive tasks (checksums, encryption, etc.)
- Implemented message passing between main and worker isolates
- Added operation queuing and result handling

## Architecture

### UnifiedP2PSocket Class
- Combines all P2P networking features in a single class
- Supports STUN/TURN/ICE for NAT traversal
- Implements ACK/NACK reliability protocol
- Includes gossip protocol and data management
- Features isolate-based multithreading for performance

### Core Components
- `p2p_socket.dart`: Core networking functionality without duplicates
- `NetAbstraction.dart`: Data models and network abstraction interfaces
- `unified_p2p_socket.dart`: The main unified implementation with multithreading

## Performance Improvements

The multithreaded implementation provides:
- Better CPU utilization for heavy operations
- Non-blocking network operations
- Improved performance during file transfers and checksum calculations
- Scalable architecture for multiple simultaneous operations

## Testing

- Updated tests to work with real IP addresses
- Validated multithreading functionality
- Verified all original features remain intact
- Confirmed proper IP discovery and connection establishment

## Usage

The unified implementation maintains backward compatibility while providing enhanced performance:

```dart
import 'package:core_lib/unified_p2p_socket.dart';

// Create a multithreaded unified socket
final socket = UnifiedP2PSocket(
  nodeId: 'my-node-id',
  numWorkers: 4, // Number of worker isolates
);

// Initialize and discover real IPs
await socket.gatherCandidates();

// Use all original functionality with multithreaded performance
socket.onMessage.listen((data) {
  print('Received: ${String.fromCharCodes(data)}');
});

// Send messages with reliability
await socket.sendWithAck(Uint8List.fromList('Hello'.codeUnits));
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Single unified class instead of multiple interconnected components
2. **Better Performance**: Multithreaded operations for CPU-intensive tasks
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend with all functionality in one place
4. **Scalability**: Improved performance under load with worker isolates
5. **Real-world Compatibility**: Works with actual network IPs instead of forced localhost
